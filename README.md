# REST API Monolith ‚Äì Dental Appointment Booking Platform

This repository contains a production-grade **monolithic REST API** built using Laravel, designed as the backend for a **dental appointment booking platform**. It showcases a scalable and maintainable architecture that encapsulates core business logic, resource management, role-based access, and notification delivery within a single service.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

The API enables users to interact with a platform that facilitates scheduling and managing dental appointments. It supports multiple user roles ‚Äî such as clients (dentists) and candidates (patients) ‚Äî and includes a complete lifecycle for job advertisements (appointments), from creation and approval to cancellation and feedback.

---

## üß± Architecture

This project follows a **layered monolithic design** using Laravel best practices:

- **Controllers** handle HTTP request/response.
- **Services** encapsulate business logic.
- **Repositories** abstract data access.
- **Requests** manage validation.
- **Resources** format JSON responses.
- **Policies** enforce role-based authorization.

The codebase is modular, readable, and optimized for scalability and separation of concerns within a monolith.
